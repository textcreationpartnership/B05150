            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORDER AND DECLARATION Of His HIGHNES COUNCIL in <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> For the GOVERNMENT thereof:</head>
            <head type="sub">Prohibiting the bringing in of any Arms or Ammunition into <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> without Licence.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas there hath been of late ſome quantity of Ammunition for VVar brought into this Nation from Forreign Parts, and entered into the Cuſtom-Houſe under the name of ſome other uſual merchandizing Commodities; by which it is evident that ſome wicked and ill-affected perſons are endeavouring to lay Deſigns for the diſturbance of the preſent Quiet, which (by the bleſsing of the Lord) is now enjoyed. The Council, for the better preventing of ſuch evil Deſigns, and that henceforth no perſon whatever may pretend ignorance, have thought it very requiſite, and do therefore hereby order and declare, That whatever perſon or perſons ſhall preſume (after pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication hereof) to bring into, and land in any part of this Nation, without expreſſe Licence firſt had and obtained from his Highneſſe Council here, or the Commander in Chief of his Highneſſe Forces in <hi>Scotland,</hi> any Arms offenſive or defenſive, or Ammunition for VVar, ſhall not only forfeit all ſuch Goods ſo brought in and landed, but alſo ſhall receive ſuch further condign puniſhment as the greatneſs of his crime ſhall deſerve. And the Commander or Maſter of any Ship or Veſſel, which ſhall after the Firſt day of <hi>July</hi> next enſuing the Date hereof, import into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and permit to be landed, any Arms or Ammunition, without Licence firſt had and obtained, as aforeſaid, ſhall not only (upon due proof thereof) undergo the pain and penalty of the loſſe and forfeiture of the Ship in which ſuch Arms and Ammunition ſhall be brought in and landed, but alſo ſhall be Impriſoned during the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's pleaſure, and endure ſuch further puniſhment as the breach of this Declaration ſhall merit. And if any perſon or perſons whatſomever, have already received any Arms or Ammunition, for which they have not had authentick Licence, They are hereby ſtrictly required to give notice thereof, and of the Quantities of the ſaid Arms or Ammunition, to the Governour of the next adjacent Garriſon, who is hereby required and authorized to ſecure the ſame, and to give ſpeedy notice thereof unto the Council, to the end the reſpective Proprietors ſo voluntarily diſcovering the ſame, may have due Compenſation given them therefore. And if any perſon or perſons ſhall make diſcovery of any Arms or Ammunition already brought in and concealed, or which hereafter ſhall be brought in and landed, contrary to the tenour of theſe Preſents, ſuch perſon and perſons making ſuch Diſcovery, ſhall not only therefore be reputed well-affected to the Quiet and Peace of this Nation, but ſhall alſo receive to the full value of one half or moyetie of the ſaid Goods, and ſuch further fitting Encouragement as ſhall be found requiſite. And all Governours of Sea-Ports, and all Officers belonging to the Cuſtoms, are hereby authorized and required to put this Order and Declaration in Execution ſo far as in them lyes. And this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation is to continue and be in force until the Firſt day of <hi>July,</hi> which ſhall be in the Year of our Lord, One thouſand ſix hundred fifty and ſeven, and no longer.</p>
